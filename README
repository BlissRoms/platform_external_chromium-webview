Building the Chromium-based WebView in AOSP is no longer supported. WebView can
now be built entirely from the Chromium source code.

General instructions for building WebView from Chromium:

------

The prebuilt libwebviewchromium.so included in these APKs is built from Chromium
release tag 51.0.2704.106. To match our build settings, use
